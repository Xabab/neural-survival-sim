# neural-survival-sim


It's a program that simulates creatures hunting for food with each creature's controls driven by evolutionary evolving feed forward neural network.

My Java cource work. As always, left for the last mounth, I think it was written in just two weeks. Maybe less. It is a lagging mess (god damn java gc) with shitload of bugs.
Later it was rewritten for another cource work, this time in Python: https://github.com/Xabab/neuron-survival-sim-py
